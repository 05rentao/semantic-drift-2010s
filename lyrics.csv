2010,"bob","airplanes"," Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky are like shooting stars? I could really use a wish right now A wish right now A wish right now Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky Are like shooting stars? I could really use a wish right now A wish right now A wish right now   Yeah, I could use a dream or a Genie or a wish To go back to a place much simpler than this 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin' And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion And all the pandemonium and all the madness There comes a time where you fade to the blackness And when you're starin' at that phone in your lap And you're hopin' but them people never call you back But that's just how the story unfolds You get another hand soon after you fold And when your plans unravel in the sand What would you wish for if you had one chance? So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night   Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now) Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now)   Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days Before this was a job, before I got paid Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank Yeah, back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant I'm guessin' that if we could make some wishes outta' airplanes Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days Before the politics that we call the rap game And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape And back before I tried to cover up my slang But this is for Decatur What's up, Bobby Ray? So can I get a wish To end the politics And get back to the music That started this shit? So here I stand and then again I say I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta' airplanes   Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now) Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars) I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now) Wish right now (Wish right now)   I could really use a wish right now (oh, oh-oh oh) I-I-I could really use a wish right now Like, like, like shootin' stars (oh, oh... oh) I-I-I-I could really use a wish right now A wish, a wish right now (A wish right now)"

Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you!"" ""No you ain't. Come back"" We're running right back Here we go again It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap ""Who's that dude?""

2013,"macklemore","cantholdus","Ay, ay, ay Good to see you, come on in, let's go Yeah, let's go Ha-ha-ha-ha Alright, alright OK, uh, alright, OK Alright, OK  Return of the Mack, get up! What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't Looking for a better way to get up out of bed Instead of getting on the Internet and checking on who hit me  Get up! Thrift shop, pimp-strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy  Yup. Bad, moon-walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway And we did it our way Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it And yet I'm on  Let that stage light go and shine on down Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style  Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town  Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track bussing Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit  Labels out here Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey) We give that to the people Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey) Labels out here Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey) We give it to the people Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)  Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us Like the ceiling can't hold us  Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us Like the ceiling can't hold us  Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful I grew up, really wanted gold fronts But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you  Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week  Raw. Time to go off. I'm gone Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome Caesar'll make you a believer  Nah I never ever did it for a throne That validation comes from giving it back to the people Nah sing this song and it goes like  ""Raise those hands, this is our party We came here to live life like nobody was watching"" I got my city right behind me If I fall, they got me Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching. I said  Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us Like the ceiling can't hold us  Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us Like the ceiling can't hold us  And so we put our hands up And so we put our hands up  Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh Let's go!  Na na na na na na na na (aha) Hey And all my people say  Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good) Hey And all my people say  Na na na na na na na na (it's alright) (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) And all my people say  Na na na na na na na na Mack-le-le-le-le-le-more   Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us Like the ceiling can't hold us Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us Like the ceiling can't hold us"
